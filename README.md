## 1. Introduction to Networking

**Objective:** Create a network topology diagram and document the network design for a small business.

### Tasks:
- Install and configure network simulation software (Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3).
- Design a network topology for a small business, including routers, switches, and basic network devices.
- Document the OSI and TCP/IP models as they apply to your design.

### Deliverables:
- [Network topology diagram](docs/intro_networking/Network_Topology_Diagram.png)
- [Installation and configuration guide of simulation software](docs/intro_networking/Installation_Configuration_Guide.md)
- [Documentation of the OSI and TCP/IP models](docs/intro_networking/OSI_TCPIP_Models_Documentation.md)

## 2. IP Addressing and Subnetting

**Objective:** Plan and configure IP addressing and subnetting for the designed network.

### Tasks:
- Create an IP address plan for the network, including IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.
- Perform subnetting calculations and apply VLSM where necessary.
- Document the IP addressing scheme and subnetting details.

### Deliverables:
- [IP address plan document](docs/ip_addressing/IP_Address_Plan.md)
- [Subnetting calculations and explanations](docs/ip_addressing/Subnetting_Calculations.md)
- [Configuration files for IP addresses and subnets](docs/ip_addressing/IP_Configuration_Files/)

## 3. Network Fundamentals

**Objective:** Configure and simulate network topologies, Ethernet standards, and VLANs.

### Tasks:
- Design and configure various network topologies (star, bus, ring, mesh).
- Configure Ethernet settings and VLANs.
- Document the configuration and the traffic segregation in VLANs.

### Deliverables:
- [Simulation files for different network topologies](docs/network_fundamentals/Topology_Configurations/)
- [VLAN configuration documentation](docs/network_fundamentals/VLAN_Configuration.md)
- [Ethernet standards and configuration files](docs/network_fundamentals/Ethernet_Standards.md)

## 4. Routing and Switching

**Objective:** Configure routing protocols, STP, and basic switch operations.

### Tasks:
- Implement static routing and dynamic routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP).
- Configure Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and basic switch settings.
- Document routing configurations and troubleshooting steps.

### Deliverables:
- [Configuration files for routing protocols](docs/routing_switching/Routing_Configurations.md)
- [STP configuration documentation](docs/routing_switching/STP_Configuration.md)
- [Troubleshooting guide](docs/routing_switching/Routing_Troubleshooting.md)

## 5. Network Security

**Objective:** Implement and document security configurations, including ACLs and device hardening.

### Tasks:
- Configure ACLs on routers to filter traffic.
- Implement basic security features (passwords, SSH) on network devices.
- Document security configurations and best practices.

### Deliverables:
- [ACL configuration files](docs/network_security/ACL_Configurations.md)
- [Security configuration documentation](docs/network_security/Device_Security_Hardening.md)

## 6. WAN Technologies

**Objective:** Configure and simulate WAN technologies and protocols.

### Tasks:
- Simulate WAN configurations using Packet Tracer or GNS3.
- Configure PPP on routers and document WAN setup.

### Deliverables:
- [WAN configuration files](docs/wan_technologies/WAN_Configurations.md)
- [PPP configuration documentation](docs/wan_technologies/PPP_Configuration.md)

## 7. IP Services

**Objective:** Configure and troubleshoot DHCP, NAT, and DNS services.

### Tasks:
- Set up DHCP on routers.
- Configure NAT and document its setup.
- Troubleshoot DNS issues and provide solutions.

### Deliverables:
- [DHCP, NAT, and DNS configuration files](docs/ip_services/)
- [Troubleshooting guide](docs/ip_services/DNS_Troubleshooting.md)

## 8. Troubleshooting and Maintenance

**Objective:** Develop and document troubleshooting procedures and maintenance tasks.

### Tasks:
- Perform troubleshooting exercises for network issues.
- Create a maintenance schedule for network devices.

### Deliverables:
- [Troubleshooting procedures document](docs/troubleshooting_maintenance/Troubleshooting_Guide.md)
- [Network maintenance checklist](docs/troubleshooting_maintenance/Maintenance_Checklist.md)
